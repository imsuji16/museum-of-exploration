                    <h3>1. Trade Routes</h3>
                    <p>Throughout the world in 1500, many empires were starting to evolve and expand. One key to expansion that led to more wealth and access to control of goods was trade routes. Trade routes were a key reason why expansion occurred during the early 1500s. If you had access to trade routes, it would essentially let you have access to facilitate goods in and out of the routes. You could also use this for taxation on those goods, leading to you gaining more wealth just from one trade route. Trade routes were fundamental to having a wealthy empire, especially in that time.</p>

                    <h3>2. Religion</h3>
                    <p>Every empire had a tolerance towards religion, whether it was freedom of any religion or tolerating only one religion. Most leaders would want the spread of their religion to be more dominant throughout their land, so most would tolerate only one religion. Expansion was key to spreading religion. Using both expansion of land and trade routes, you could spread ideas within merchants or your own land, leading to a religion being more dominant, whether that is Catholic or Christian. Having your religion spread more acts as an influence on other empires around you.</p>

                    <h3>3. Strength</h3>
                    <p>During the 1500s, empires were growing stronger by the day. When someone had a better army, they would probably be more dominant in the world. Even today, the military is key to being a world superpower. But most importantly, strength leads to expansion. Think of it as a game of war. When a war occurs, it leads to mass destruction, especially when it involves strength. When one wins, they usually win due to having more skilled power, and when they win, they conquer land, which is considered expansion, but in a more aggressive way.</p>

                    <h3>4. Economy</h3>
                    <p>Many forms of wealth were found in empires, primarily gold and silver. There were many ways to gain wealth during the 1500s. Many would mine or trade using trade routes. This led to a gain in economic value throughout many empires. Having a unique material found in your region for trade would lead to you being a source of trade and you having a gain in the economy. For example, in early China, they would trade porcelain and paper, mainly found in their region, which led to them being a good source of trade. This would have one problem: maintaining the goods for trade. Early China had to balance the output of paper and porcelain within its empire, or it would have too little trade or too much. The economy led to expansion, too. Not wanting to go to war with an empire to gain land was a common theme within this period, especially if you were not that strong during that period. So instead, they would use economic resources to buy land, small or big, leading to expansion over time.</p>

                    <h3>5. Location</h3>
                    <p>Many civilizations came from others, going back to the early ages of ancient Egypt. Many would have geographical advantages within their empire. Some would have access to trade routes, while others would have access to oceans and mines with valuables. This led to the development of other factors in expansion, such as their economy and, most importantly, trade routes. Location is the foundation of getting stronger within an empire, so many would have to have advantages in order to expand further than before.</p>

                    <h3>6. Governance</h3>
                    <p>An empire needs a strong leader to maintain wealth and strength within the empire. But just having a leader could lead to casualties within the empire, like when someone needs to get help, they would need to ask the king or queen. That's why the main empires would have many political systems to maintain stability within the empire. For example, ancient Japan had a feudal system of government, leading to it becoming stronger within the empire itself, maintaining good wealth and strength. Governance also directed what to do and how to expand.</p>

                    <h3>7. War</h3>
                    <p>War was the most used way to expand, especially during the modern era. This was because there was no land to conquer anymore, so the only way to expand was to take action. Another reason could be landlocked reasons, because you were isolated from everything else. This was the most common conflict reason within the 1500s, resulting in many wars during the period. There were many more reasons for war, such as wealth, strength, or just pure hatred within a certain empire. War still happens today, and many think that it could result in the world's demise with just one tiny slip.</p>

                <div class="exhibit-text">
                    <h3>1. Renaissance</h3>
                    <p>The Renaissance is a huge part of the Reformation. Its literal definition is "rebirth", and it refers to the spread and revival of art and culture. The Renaissance began in northern Italy, and improved trade in Florence, Venice, and Genoa. This doesn't have to do with expansion directly; it's more of an indirect relationship. Because of the Renaissance, these previously mentioned Italian cities (Florence, Venice, Genoa) became amplified as a central trading area throughout the continent. This rise in wealth, along with the newly rich cities, resulted in the funding of shipbuilding and navigation, ultimately leading to expansion.</p>

                    <h3>2. Protestantism</h3>
                    <p>The spread of Protestantism is another branch of the Reformation that advances the structure of expansion in the 1500s. Protestantism, in simple terms, is essentially the events that follow the bold protest by Martin Luther — a German monk who posted his 95 theses in 1517. His harsh theses criticized the church for their involvement, goals, and sale of indulgences. This eventually led to a conflictual divide in Europe (Protestant Reformation). The divide naturally sparked competition between Protestants and Catholics. It wasn't purely religious either, since it quickly leaked into politics. In time, a rising rivalry promoted expansion with the tensions between the two sides. </p>

                    <p>Protestantism was one of the biggest religions during the period after the Renaissance. But another religion was also known in the period, Calvinism. People who believed in Calvinism were called Calvinists and were created and based on John Calvin. Unlike Protestantism, Calvinists believed in a different way of salvation known as predestination. This led to differences between both two religions and caused a separation in Europe during that time. It was spread and located in western Europe in places like France or England. </p>

                    <p>The Catholic Counter Reformation was one of the most important reasons that wanted an end to the spread of Protestantism. It started in 1545 and ended more than a century later in 1648. It was an attempt to bring back the Catholic Church but instead on spiritual beliefs. It mainly started as a reaction to the Protestant Reformation due to the rise in Protestantism and Catholicism had no way to counter it until now. It had been started by the Council of Trent which started to “rebrand” the catholic church.

                    <p>Technological Advancements were founded after the Renaissance and led to new ideas to be created. The Humanism Movement was founded due to the many inventions that occurred. It moved away from the church as being the center for information. This also expanded on Greek and Roman beliefs and made it more known to the people of different beliefs of the past. It also made the way things change drastically and spread from one kingdom to another.

                    <p>Martin Luther also known as the father of protestantism was a key figure in religion and beliefs. In 1517 he posted the “95 Theses” on the church’s door in Wittenburg, Germany. He challenged not just the Catholics themselves but its beliefs as well saying that god and faith are the only right beliefs. This also initiated the Protestant Reformation. In 1521 he was excommunicated at the Diet of Worms due to him refusing to recant his criticisms. This led to the spread of Protestantism and a new challenge for Catholics and their beliefs.

Many artists started to create many pieces that were the center of culture within Europe. Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Petrarch were artists and poets that created pieces such as the Mona Lisa and Sonnets. This concept led to the spread of ideas,culture, and writings throughout Europe. Many of these ideas started in places such as Venice and Florence located in Italy.

                    <p>After the period of the Renaissance, empires started to develop faster than ever before. One common thing during this time was ship development. This led to exploration and expansion becoming more common, and also led to the discovery of the New World. Two kingdoms stood out when finding the New World. Spain and England both claimed land within the New World. This was due to the desire to explore within this period. This started a new era of exploration within the world, and many more were to come.</p>

Portugal also started to get involved, with the first to start exploring more of Africa. Many were focused on the New World during this period of expansion, but the Portuguese found that there was more land within Africa, too. They wanted to control trade routes, specifically allowing them to have control over more goods. After getting these routes, many other countries, even Spain, eventually came to take part in this exploration of Africa.</p>

                    <p>Many factors drive the reason to explore. During the age of exploration, there were three that stood out for Spain. Gold, Glory, and God. (GGG) God was the most important of them because of Catholicism giving them the drive to explore specifically the New World. Gold was also a reason for exploration within the New World. Many within Spain thought that the New World would contain so much wealth that it made them wealthy. Finally Glory which is the factor that led the people to invest in the exploration of the New World. Spain wanted to control land and have freedom for its people rather than claiming trade routes or becoming the strongest and most powerful. These led to Spain becoming the most powerful event though their intention was to just grant peace and stability to their people. </p>

                    <p>Britain and Spain were the strongest during the Age of Exploration. But another kingdom that stood out was France. They didn’t stand out for the reasons that most would think of, which were wealth and strength. Instead they stand out for being the most friendly. The New World mainly consisted of Britain and Spanish territory but there was also New France territory located in present day Canada. Both Britain and Spain were harsh on the natives and took their land in specific because they saw them as a threat. But unlike them the French cooperated with the Native Americans because “they didn’t seek after their land. This act of kindness led them to expand much easier and with less conflict unlike other empires and kingdoms within the New World.</p>

                    <p>During the Age of Exploration many sought after the New World. But after the findings of empires within Africa many began to also trade and get land in Africa. But what they traded was unusual from the rest of the world. They traded slaves which many empires needed during that time and were very interested in their offerings. Many would offer things not usually found in Africa and many would just threaten them for slaves. This led to development of the Atlantic Slave Trade Route and was basically the only trade route to give slaves. Slaves were important because it led to development of crops and goods more and led to better wealth. It also benefited strength adding more towards the army.</p>

                    <h3>6. Permanent Settlements</h3>
                    <p>With many ways of transportation developing many people started to explore. But it was hard for many to get goods back and forth to supply the needs of the people. Though the British were smart and created permanent settlements. This led to people not having to go back and forth between continents to get goods and instead could just get it from the settlements itself. This also led to exploration being faster and having more time to actually find land to conquer rather than just staying in one place. Permanent settlements were key to exploration at its peak.</p>

                    <h3>7. The Middle Passage</h3>
                    <p>The Middle Passage was the most important zone of transportation within the world. It was mainly used to transport goods and services between the New World and Europe. It was also used as a trade route for goods between civilizations located in South America and present day Mexico. Common items found for trade within the Middle Passage include manufactured goods and textiles from Europe and animal related items from within the New World. The Middle Passage was the most important way of transportation within the world especially because faster transportation wasn’t yet invented and the best thing they had was ships and sails.</p>
